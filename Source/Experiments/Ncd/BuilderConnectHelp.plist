The NCDBuilder MUST be connected so the data con be built as the run progresses. If it is not connected, it is a pain to build the data offline.

If the builder is running properly it will connect to ORCA automatically. It may have crashed. Restart the builder as needed. 

Note that there is NO need to restart ORCA. 

ORCA checks this alarm every 30 seconds while a run is in progress.
This alarm will go away when the builder is connected.
Acknowledging this alarm will silence it.
