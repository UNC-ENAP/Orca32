The NCD experimental setup requires that there be one and only one dispatcher present in the configuration. Check the configuration and fix as needed.

ORCA checks this alarm every 30 seconds while a run is in progress.
This alarm will go away when the number of dispatchers in the configuration is equal to one.
Acknowledging this alarm will silence it.
