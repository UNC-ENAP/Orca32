At the start of a run the state of the hardware is checked against an earlier snapshot of the hardware state.

The position of the shapers cards, thresholds, gains,  and modes are compared to the snapshot. This alarm indicates that something has changed.
Check the status log for more information.

This alarm will go away when the current state matches the snapshot. You can capture the current state using the controls on the NCD dialog.

Acknowledging this alarm will silence it.
