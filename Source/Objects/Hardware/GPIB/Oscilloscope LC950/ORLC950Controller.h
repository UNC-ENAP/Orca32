/*!\class	ORLC950Controller
 * \brief	This class is the top level class handling interaction between the
 *			LeCroy 950 GUI and its hardware.
 * \methods
 *			\li \b 	init						- Constructor - Opens correct nib
 *			\li \b 	dealloc						- Unregister messages, cleanup.
 *			\li \b	connect						- Connect device to GPIB.
 *			\li \b	primaryAddressChanged		- Respond when person changes address.
 *			\li \b	secondaryAddressChanged		- Respond when person changes address.
 * \private
 *			\li \b	populatePullDowns			- Populate pulldowns in GUI.
 * \note	1) The hardware access methods use the internally stored state
 *			   to actually set the hardware.  Thus one first has to use the
 *			   accessor methods prior to setting the oscilloscope hardware.
