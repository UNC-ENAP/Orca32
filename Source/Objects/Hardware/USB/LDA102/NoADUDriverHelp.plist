The configuration has one of the LDA102 USB relay I/O interfaces, but it appears that the driver has not been installed. 
You need to locate the LDA102.pkg installer in the Drivers folder of the distribution, double-click on the installer, and reboot.

The driver is a code-less kext that prevents the system from grabbing the ADU unit for exclusive access.

Acknowledging this alarm will make it go away.
