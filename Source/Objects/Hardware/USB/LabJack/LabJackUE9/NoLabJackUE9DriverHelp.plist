The configuration has one of the Lab Jack U12 I/O interfaces, but it appears that the driver has not been installed. 
You need to locate the LabJackUE9U12.pkg installer in the Drivers folder of the distribution, double-click on the installer, and reboot.

The driver is a code-less kext that prevents the system from grabbing the Lab Jack unit for exclusive access.

Acknowledging this alarm will make it go away.
