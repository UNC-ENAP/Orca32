The configuration has one of the PCI->VME/Mac (i.e. 617/620/810) cards, but a hardware check finds no 
such card installed in the Mac. 

Installing the correct PCI->VME card in the mac and/or modifying the configuration to match the physical hardware will make this alarm go away.

Acknowledging this alarm will silence it.
