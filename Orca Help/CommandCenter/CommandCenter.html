Remote commands can do such things as start/stop runs, request status information, etc. The command center is opens from the main menu, Windows-&gt;Command Center. The setup dialog of the command center provides a port number for client to connect to, however in the current version of ORCA the port is hardcoded to be port 4667.</p>		<p>The format of the commands is a modified form of Obj-C method calls. For example, the command to start a run from a remote client is:</p>		<p><i>[RunControl remoteStartRun:123];</i></p>		<p>This would start run number 123. The internal ORCA run number is ignored when runs are started with this command. Simularly stopping the run would be:</p>		<p><i>[RunControl stopRun];</i></p>		<p>The commands can be any Obj-C method  understood by the object, with the exception that the argments, if any, can not be pointers. The receiver of the command must either be the name of a registered object, such as RunControl or HeartBeat, or it can the general ID of a hardware object. For example, the command</p>		<p><i>[ORShaper,0,1 setThreshold:3 withValue:23];</i></p>		<p>would set the threshold for the shaper card in crate 0, slot 1. If the crate and card is left off, </p>		<p><i>[ORShaper setThreshold:3 withValue:23];</i></p>		<p>the channel 3 threshold of ALL shaper cards would be set. There is no way to set the values of all channels with one command at this time. To do that, use the <a href="../HardwareWizard/HardwareWizard.html">Hardware Wizard.</a></p>		<p>Multiple commands can be sent as long as the ';' separates all commands. Also, a file full of commands can be sent from the dialog (see below). The input dialog is meant mainly to test suits of commands that a remote client might send.</p>		<p>Note that the commands descibed above are NOT <a href="../OrcaScripts/ScriptOverview.html">OrcaScript</a> commands.</p>		<p><img src="CommandCenter.gif" alt="" width="438" height="448" border="0"></p>		<p></p>		<p><a href="../OrcaScript/ScriptOverview.html">OrcaScripts</a> can be entered in the Scripting tab:</p>		<p><img src="ScriptTab.png" alt="" width="706" height="558" border="0"></p>	</body></html>
