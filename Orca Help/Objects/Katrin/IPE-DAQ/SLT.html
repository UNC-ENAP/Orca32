The Slt provides central functions for the			   IPE-DAQ electronics. The card is used to store and initiate the configuration of 			   the SLT and all FLTs. It provides a inhibit and trigger signal.		    <p>To enable the software trigger for all Flts the trigger source "software" has to be			   selected. 			</p>			<p>Using the inhibit source "external" the data aquisition can be controlled by			   an external hardware signal. Enable the deadtime counters to measure the effective run time.			</p>		</div>	</body></html>
