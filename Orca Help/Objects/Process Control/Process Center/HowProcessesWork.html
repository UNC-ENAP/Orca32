Input switch #1 is linked to a hardware input bit at crate1, card2, IPB channel 3. Switch #2 is linked to the same IPB module channel1, switch #3 to channel 0. Output #1 is linked to channel 15 and Output #2 to channel 16. In order for the Outputs to set their hardware bits to '1' all of the Inputs switches must read a '1' from their hardware channels. </p>			<p><img src="example1.png" alt="" width="461" height="111" border="0"></p>			<p><i>Example 1.</i> Switches #1 and #2 are reading 1's from their IP408 channels, but since #1 is a pass-thru the AND gate sees the value from #3 and thus is not satisfied.</p>			<p><img src="example2.png" alt="" width="464" height="116" border="0"></p>			<p><i>Example 2.</i> Here switches #2 and #3 are reading 1's from their IP408 channels, but  the pass-thru switch #1 is blocking the signal from reaching the AND gate.</p>			<p><img src="example3.png" alt="" width="462" height="109" border="0"></p>			<p><i>Example 3.</i> Here all switches  are reading 1's from their IP408 channels, so the AND gate passes a '1' on to Output #1. Since it is acting as a pass-thru, the signal also reads the endpoint and both outputs are able to set their IP408 bits to '1'.</p>			<hr>			<p><a href="../../../Objects.html">Objects</a> | <a href="ProcessCenter.html">Process Center</a> | <a href="../Process%20Container/Process%20Container.html">Process Container</a> | <a href="../Process%20Elements/ProcessElements.html">Process Elements</a></p>		</div>	</body></html>
