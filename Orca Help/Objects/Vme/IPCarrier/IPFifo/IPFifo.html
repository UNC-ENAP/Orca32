This object was created early in the development cycle of ORCA to  test certain internal framework designs and is currently  used only for testing purposes. Perhaps some future version of ORCA will develop this card more fully. The card can only be placed into an <a href="../IPCarrier.html">IP Carrier</a> board and the configuration icon looks like this:  <img src="IPFifo.gif" alt="" width="58" height="125" align="top" border="0"></p>		<p>The dialog is self explanatory:</p>		<p><img src="IPFifoDialog.gif" alt="" width="464" height="150" border="0"></p>	</body></html>
