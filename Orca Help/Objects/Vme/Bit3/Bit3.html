If you are getting VME exceptions during read/write operations, it may be that the jumpers on the board are incorrect. The jumper setting for using the Bit 3 board <i>without</i> an eCPU are as follows:</p>		<ul>			<li> J12: should only have jumper across #4.       			<li>J3: should only have jumper across #2, 3, 4, 5 only. #1, 6 &amp; 7 should be open.			<li>J11: all open.			<li>J4: jumper across #3 only.			<li>J2: (looking from the 0 label there are 4 pins across. #'s 0, 1, &amp; 2 should have pins 2 &amp; 3 jumpered. #3 should have pins 1 &amp; 2 jumpered and pins 3 &amp; 4 jumpered. The last row of this connector is labeled on the end ARB and P/R. ARB should be jumpered and P/R should be open.			<li>J9: all should be jumpered EXCEPT #13 HI.			<li>J10: all should be jumpered EXCEPT #13 LO.			<li>J13: all should be jumpered.			<li>J14: all should be jumpered EXCEPT 31 and A24 (A24 is on the right side of 16 as you are looking at the board, it is the end set of pins on the opposite end of 31).			<li>J5: all should be jumpered.			<li>J6: all should be jumpered EXCEPT 31 and A24 (A24 is on the right side of 16 as you are looking at the board, it is the end set of pins on the opposite end of 31).			<li>J8: all open.						<li>J7: all should be jumpered. These are 3 pin sets, the pins that should be jumpered are the middle pin and the pin closest to the pin numbering (or closest to the VME connector).			<li>			<p>The jumper setting for using the Bit 3 board <i>with</i> an eCPU and dual port memory are as follows:</p>			<li>J12: should be all open.			<li>J3: should only have jumper across # 3, 5 only. #1, 2, 4, 6 &amp; 7 should be open.			<li>J11: all open.			<li>J4: jumper across #3 only.			<li>J2: (looking from the 0 label there are 4 pins across. #'s 0, 1, &amp; 2 should have pins 2 &amp; 3 jumpered. #3 should have pins 1 &amp; 2 jumpered and pins 3 &amp; 4 jumpered.
