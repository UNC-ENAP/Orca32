In the <a href="../Preferences/Preferences.html#Anchor-47857">preferences dialog</a>, security passwords can be set or changed, and the security can be enabled or disabled. A password is required to disable system-wide security. It is useful to disable security during development of a configuration to minimize the hassles of dealing with locking and unlocking dialogs.</p>			<p><img src="Unlocked.gif" alt="" width="33" height="36" border="0"> In the lower left corner of most dialogs you will find a lock that is determines the security state of that dialog. If it is greyed-out then system-wide security is NOT enabled and you can do whatever you want. It is <i>not</i> greyed-out and it is locked, you must click it to gain access to any disabled features on that dialog that are linked to the security system.</p>			<p><img src="Locked.gif" alt="" width="33" height="36" border="0">In some dialogs, features are locked out while a run is in progress and unlocking the lock will have not allow you access. Other features are tied not only to whether or not a run is in progress, but also to the type of run--usually a <a href="../Objects/Control/RunControl/RunControl.html">maintenence run type</a>.</p>		</div>		<div align="center">			</div>	</body></html>
