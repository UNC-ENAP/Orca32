When this driver package is not installed several interface files will be missing. You can find the drivers in the Drivers folder of the distribution.			</div>		</ul>		<div align="left">			<p></p>			<p>Why does ORCA crash when I try to use a <a href="Objects/PCI/617Controller/617Controller.html#Anchor-The-14210">617</a> or <a href="Objects/PCI/620Controller/620.html#Anchor-The-23240">620</a> PCI card?</p>			<ul>				<li>You need to install the drivers. This is a bug in ORCA which is caused by not trapping certain hardware related exceptions. It will be fixed in some future version of ORCA. For now, you have to install a PCI driver for the card you are trying to use. You can find the drivers in the Drivers folder of the distribution.			</ul>			<p></p>			<p>I just downloaded the newest version of ORCA and it won't build. Why not?</p>			<ul>				<li>Check that you really have the lastest version of the project and all of the new files.				<li>Sometimes when we add new files, we forget to check in the project.			</ul>			<div align="left">				<p></p>				<p>I installed a new <a href="Objects/Vme/Bit3/Bit3.html#Anchor-The-35882">Bit 3</a> controller board and I'm getting VME exceptions during read/write operations. Why?</p>				<ul>					<li>The jumpers on the board are incorrect. <a href="Objects/Vme/Bit3/Bit3.html#Anchor-The-47857">Here</a> are the correct jumper setttings.				</ul>			</div>			<p></p>			<p>I need to go back a version to verify that I have a hardware problem and not a software problem. How do I do that?</p>			<ul>				<li>Starting with version 2.6.6 we started tagging the versions in cvs. <a href="Installation.html#Anchor-Getting-49575">Here</a> is how to grab an old version.							<li>To return to the current version you must <a href="Installation.html#Anchor-Fixing-47857">remove the sticky tag</a> and update.</ul>			<p></p>			<p>I reverted to an older version of a couple of files and now CVS won't work right with them.</p>			<ul>				<li>CVS views revisions as snapshots in history and won't allow changes. The same thing happens when the entire project is reverted. You have to <a href="Installation.html#Anchor-Fixing-49575">remove the sticky tag</a> for those files.</ul>			<p></p>			<p>How do I report bugs?</p>			<ul>				<li>Send bug reports to <a href="mailto:howe@npl.washington.edu">Mark Howe</a>. Please include as much information as possible. especially if there was a crash. For crashes the information that is important include things like:					<ul>						<li>What is the Orca version?						<li>What is the OS version? We are definitely moving into using Cocoa additions from 10.3 and up. If you are running 10.2 or lower, there will be some things that don't work.						<li>Exactly what actions led up to the crash? In a run or not, etc.?						<li>What objects are in the configuration? Maybe include the configuration file in the report.						<li>If it is reproducible, try running in the debugger and take a snapshot of the stack dump if possible.					</ul>								<li>Starting with version 2.6.x ORCA can automatically send the crash logs to us. If you are having problems, please enable this <a href="Preferences/Preferences.html#Anchor-ORCA-11481">feature</a>.			</ul>			<p></p>			<p></p>		</div>	</body></html>
