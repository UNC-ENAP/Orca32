They hold the hardware's state and define the logic that manipulates that state. They are also responsible with storing the persistent state of the object and reloading that state when the application is started. In general, ORCA model objects have no connection to the user interface used to present and edit that object's state. There is always a one-to-one correspondence between a piece of hardware and the software model that represents that hardware.

All of the dialogs are built graphically using Interface Builder that results in a nib file that is loaded on demand whenever a dialog is opened. The only exceptions are a few specialized NSView subclasses that do special custom drawing, such as plotting.</p>			<h3>Controllers</h3>			<p>The controller object acts as glue code between the model and the view. They are in charge of making sure that the view has access to the model data that needs to be displayed and are the conduit through which view learns about changes to the model. They also funnel user initiated changes back to the model. One model may actually have many controllers displaying many aspects of its data in multiple views.

For example, the AD811 CAMAC object has the following files:</p>			<ul>				<li>ORAD811Model.m       <font color="#cc0033">--holds all of the AD811 state information and methods to access hw</font>				<li>ORAD811Model.h				<li>ORAD811Controller.m    <font color="#cc0033">--this is the glue between the user dialog and the model</font>				<li>ORAD811Controller.h				<li>AD811.nib                     <font color="#cc0033">--generated by Interface Builder. It 's the GUI dialog.</font>				<li>AD811Card.tif               <font color="#cc0033">--the object's icon</font>			</ul>			<p>In addition, ORCA files that can produce data will have two additional files:</p>			<ul>				<li>ORAD811Decoder.m    <font color="#cc0033">--called by the data monitor for histogramming and the data explorer for record display </font>				<li>ORAD811Decoder.h			</ul>			<p><a href="Controller.html">controller</a> | <a href="Model.html">model</a></p>		</div>	</body></html>
