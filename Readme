You must install any needed drivers before hardware accesses will work. Find what you need in the drivers folder. 

starting with svn:

 -copying the whole project from another source is OK unless you want to use version control. Then you must get the Orca folder from the subversion server using svn.
 
1)put the following in your .tcshrc file:

  setenv SVN_EDITOR vi   //or pico or whatever you want

2)re-log in or source the .tcshrc file.
       
3) get the sources
cd Dev
svn co svn://orca.physics.unc.edu/Orca
svn co svn://orca.physics.unc.edu/OrcaPlugin

if you use OrcaRoot:
svn co svn://orca.physics.unc.edu/OrcaRoot
	
Drivers:
svn co svn://orca.physics.unc.edu/Drivers

-double-click on the Orca.xcodeproj file to launch project builder and compile the code.
-alternatively type "open Orca.xcodeproj"

Updating
-to do a normal update with no new files you can use the project builder svn functions.
 
-to do a full update from the command line do:
cd Dev
svn update Orca
