You must install the NI driver before ORCA will build correctly.

You must install any needed drivers before hardware accesses will work. Find what you need in the drivers folder. 

starting with CVS:

 -copying the whole project from another source is OK unless you want to use cvs. Then you must get the Orca folder from the cvs server using cvs.
 
1)put the following in your .tcshrc file:

  setenv CVSROOT :pserver:username@128.95.100.177:/Users/orca/cvs
  setenv CVS_RSH ssh
  setenv CVSEDITOR pico

  Note: If you do not have an account use 'anonymous' as the username and the password.

  
2)copy the cvswrappers file into your home dir and rename to .cvswrappers
  
3)re-log in or source the .tcshrc file.
    
4)Now cvs should be ready to work. The first time you use the Orca cvs server you must login:
   
   ocvs login
   
   and enter your password. You shouldn't have to do a login again.
   
5)get Orca:
  
	cd Dev
	ocvs checkout Orca
	
-double-click on the Orca.xcodeproj file to launch project builder and compile the code.
	

-Note that the Drivers folder and the OrcaPalette folder are not under cvs at this time. You can copy them from the distribution CD.

Updating
 
 -to do a normal update with no new files you can use the project builder cvs functions.
 
 -to grab new files,or to grab a new version of the project it's a little tricky. do the following 

1)cd Dev/Orca
2)rename your Orca.xcodeproj file to something else or delete it (rm -rf Orca.xcodeproj)
3)cd ..
4)ocvs update -d Orca
