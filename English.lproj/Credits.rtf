Orca evolved from SHaRC, an Object-Oriented  \
DAQ programming project carried out by John\
Wilkerson and Frank McGirt at LANL in the \
1980's and further  refined by Mark Howe and \
others at the Center for Nuclear  Physics and \
Astrophysics at the University of Washington\
during the 1990's. In 2008, Mark Howe moved\
to the University of North Carolina. The main\
location of ORCA development moved to \
UNC with him.\
